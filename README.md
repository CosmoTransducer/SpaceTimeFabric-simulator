# SpaceTimeFabric-simulator
visualization of how mass warps spacetime, inspired by Einstein's general theory of relativity
explaination by simulating the classic "rubber sheet" analogy using Python and matplotlib

###

### > general theory of relativity:
in simple words mass and energy tell spacetime how to curve, and curved spacetime tells matter how to move

higher the mass or higher the concentrated energy --> stronger and bigger the curve is --> means more stronger gravitational force of that object is


### 

### > key requirements 
- i need to simulate mass and energy 
- need to simulate how the object around other object behaves (relativity) 
- need to simulate the time too, which depends on how intense space-time fabric curve is  
- key understanding of python libs
- clear understanding of general theory of relativity
