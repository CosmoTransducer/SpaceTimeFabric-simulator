# SpaceTimeFabric-simulator
visualization of how mass warps spacetime, inspired by Einstein's general theory of relativity
explaination by simulating the classic "rubber sheet" analogy using Python and matplotlib

# general theory of relativity:
in simple words mass and energy tell spacetime how to curve, and curved spacetime tells matter how to move

higher the mass or higher the concentrated energy --> bigger the curve is --> means more stronger gravitational force of that object is

# key requirements 
- i need to simulate mass and energy and how the object around other object behaves
- need to simulate the time too , which depends on fabric curve 
- key understanding of python libs
- crystal clear understanding of general theory of relativity
